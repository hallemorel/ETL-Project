For this project I worked with two of my classmates to complete a Case Study.

As a group we collected data from the U.S. Census Bureau on the popularity of baby names at the national level, the state level and the city level. Specifically we focused on New York state and New York City.

Once the datasets were identified we underwent data cleaning using Python in order to be able to extract the information we wanted from the sources.

From this we created a final database.

We used SQL to create and link these three datasets at the national, state and city levels. 

After manipulating the data in Python we concluded with a final report on the our findings of the relations between baby names at the three levels.
